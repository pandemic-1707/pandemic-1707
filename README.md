# Hi, I'm ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥PLANETAMICðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

I'm the capstone project for three students at the Grace Hopper Program.  

You might know me in board-game form as Pandemic, the cooperative board game designed by Matt Leacock and published by Z-Man Games in 2007.

I'm based on the premise that four diseases have broken out in the world, each threatening to wipe out a region. I accommodate 2 to 4 players, each playing one of five possible specialists: dispatcher, medic, scientist, researcher, or operations expert. I'm unlike most games in that the gameplay is cooperative, rather than competitive. Through the combined effort of all the players, the goal is to discover all four cures before any of my several game-losing conditions are reached.

I use React and Firebase and am integrated with Leaflet.
